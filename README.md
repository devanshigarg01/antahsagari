Working on image processing for an underwater ROV with an aim to provide a solution for gathering underwater data from the bed of the mighty Brahmaputra river.

A novel model by combining the merits
of deep learning and classical histogram equalization. Specifically,
instead of directly learning an image-to-image mapping function, we
first design a two-branch network to separately handle global color
distortion and local contrast reduction. This strategy is motivated by
the observation that most underwater images are dominated by a
relative single and uniform color distribution
